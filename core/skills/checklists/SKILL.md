Full checklists in [checklists.md](checklists.md).

**When to apply each checklist — trigger automatically:**

| Action | Checklist |
|---|---|
| Adding any new feature or behaviour | **Feature Addition** |
| Creating or modifying an API endpoint | **API Endpoint** |
| Changing the data model / schema | **Data Model Change** |
| Adding any log statement | **Logging** |
| Adding any secret or credential handling | **Secrets & Credentials** |
| Any code touching authentication or authorisation | **Auth & Authorisation** |

Apply the checklist **before marking work as done**. Every unchecked item is a gap that needs addressing or an explicit decision to skip with a documented reason.
