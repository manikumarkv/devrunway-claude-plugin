Full standards in [neon-branching.md](neon-branching.md). Always-on summary.

**Scope:** enforceable CI rules only. For the branch-type decision tree and full CLI reference use the official `neon-postgres-branches` skill. For connection strings and migration mechanics see the `neon` layer.

**Branch type:**
- **Normal branch** — migration validation. Copies real row shapes and volumes, which is what makes the test meaningful.
- **Schema-only branch** — when the parent holds PII. Structure without rows.
- Schema-only branches are **independent root branches** — no parent, no shared history. `reset --parent` does not apply to them, so never design a CI flow around resetting one.

**Branch-per-PR lifecycle:**
- Create on PR open; delete on merge **and** on close-without-merge — these are different events, and missing the second is the usual leak
- Name the branch deterministically from the PR number so a re-run reuses instead of duplicating
- Cleanup job runs `if: always()`

**Always set an expiry, even when you have a delete step.** `--expires-at`, or `ttl` in `neon.ts`. The delete step does not run when a job is cancelled or the runner dies — expiry is the only backstop that survives that, and orphaned branches are the most common source of unexpected Neon cost.

**Migration gating:** run migrations on the PR's branch using `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`, against a branch **of production** — never an empty database. An empty DB will not catch a backfill that times out or a `NOT NULL` added to a populated table.

**Secrets:** `NEON_API_KEY` from CI secrets only. Mask the branch connection string; never `echo` it into logs. Never expose the API key to fork PRs — see the `pull_request_target` hazard.

**Never:** share one CI database across parallel jobs · disable scale-to-zero on CI branches · leave cleanup off the failure path.

**Related:** `neon`, `naming-conventions`, `data-governance`, `secret-scanning`.
