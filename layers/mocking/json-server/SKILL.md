Full standards in [json-server.md](json-server.md). Always-on summary:

**db.json:**
- Each top-level key becomes a REST resource: `GET /users`, `POST /users`, `DELETE /users/:id`
- Always include an `id` field — json-server uses it for relationship resolution and updates
- Seed data should be realistic and cover edge cases (empty lists, long strings, boundary values)

**routes.json:**
- Use `routes.json` to rewrite paths: `{ "/api/*": "/$1" }` strips the `/api` prefix
- Keep rewrites minimal — complex logic belongs in custom middleware, not route rewrites

**Custom middleware:**
- Add delays: `json-server --middlewares delay.js` with `res.header('X-Response-Time', ...)`
- Simulate auth: check `req.headers.authorization` in middleware; return 401 if missing
- Add custom endpoints that db.json cannot express (aggregations, computed fields)

**CI usage:**
- Start json-server before tests: `json-server --watch db.json --port 3001 &`
- Use `--delay 300` to catch loading states; use `--delay 0` for speed in unit tests
- Reset db.json between test suites — copy from a fixture file, not in-place mutation

**Never:**
- Use json-server as a production backend — it is a dev/test tool only
- Commit a mutated db.json — the file is rewritten on POST/PUT/DELETE; gitignore or restore in CI
- Put sensitive data in db.json — it is served as plain JSON with no auth by default
